Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Conclusion
Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are.

The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort.

An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Conclusion
Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong.

They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Conclusion
Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop!

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Conclusion
Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

When was your last time you read a book?

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only.

Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Conclusion
Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Conclusion
Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Conclusion
Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.

Reading books

When was your last time you read a book?

Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly apparently you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.

Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults don’t read because they are unconscious about the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.

In this so-called modern world, people get so much involved in most pressing challenges and activities they believe to be interesting. Going to work, browsing the internet, looking for money, decadence, social media, etc., consume most of people’s time. None the less, reading books is not part of their schedule.

The biggest challenge most people are unaware that mind needs sharpening, it needs stimulation, it needs to be maintained and principally; it needs continual development. Well maintained mind functions at its best. Neglected mind is dysfunctional all the time.

Ignorant people you get to know them by the way they speak, behave, and live – they are disorganised. The difference between ignorant people and knowledgeable people – ignorant people are foolish knowledgeable people are wise. Foolishness is not sold anywhere; it is a fatal disease acquired by persons who refuse to learn. Wisdom is not sold anywhere; it is a reward for persons who are hungry for knowledge.

Ignorant people are destroying this world. All sufferings of this world are caused by ignorant people. Wars, poverty, diseases, corruption, inequality, crime, inflation, etc. – things don’t just happen. Bad things happen due to mistakes and carelessness. And the root trigger of all mistakes and carelessness is unwillingness to enhance the mind.

Mistakes and carelessness happen due to failure in thinking. Failure to think occurs due to lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge occurs due to failure in acquiring enough of good knowledge. Failure to acquire enough of good knowledge leads to complete destruction. Reading books is the only dependable source of acquiring knowledge.

Excuses vs. Benefits of reading books

Benefits of reading books avidly are countless. Some people never realised that a person does not live on bread and butter only. A person primarily exists due to the amount of good knowledge in their mind. The more of good knowledge a person possesses the better. An empty mind leads to instant death – because a person can live whilst dead – mobile corpse. Muscle does not make a person strong, eating books make a person strong. 

Dangers of being ignorant

Ignorant people are more dangerous than poisonous poison. By all means, do your best to stay away from ignorant people. If you keep company with ignorant people you will be like them. If you associate yourself with five totally ignorant chaps, so it means you will be the sixth one.

There is factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object) and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge to do something. Principally, real ignorance is when a person chooses to be incapable of doing or practising most crucial things in life and living. Every one of us must strive to know how to love, understand, think and reason. Because the root cause of conflict is ignorance. By factors of thinking all humans meet.

The biggest challenge about ignorant people is that they refuse to learn – they feel complacent. They are stuck in one place. They don’t want to move forward. Their minds are dying every day. Ever since, I have never witnessed a successful ignorant/foolish person.

The worst danger is intellectual bankruptcy.

Once you embrace ignorance then intellectual bankruptcy becomes your best companion. Intellectual bankruptcy is a phrase I have coined to define a person who opts to lack the ability to think. Intellectual bankruptcy is completely fatal and gives rise to such serious diseases like low reasoning capacity, poor judgement, lack of emotional intelligence, fear, lack of definite purpose, mistakes, carelessness, extravagance, hedonism, etc.

That is what comes about whenever you stop reading books avidly – it really happens whenever you stop increasing your knowledge incessantly – you become an intellectually bankrupt animal.

The most read book in the world – the bestselling book of all time

According to the Genesis world record as of 1995, the Holy Bible is the bestselling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed worldwide.

The reason why the Bible is the bestseller and most read book on earth is because people are curious, they are desperate. People want to know who they are. The Bible talks about no any other book talks about on earth. It gives an account of human creation, what went wrong and the solution. For more information it requires you to read the Holy Bible yourself.  For a comprehensive list of books related to the Holy Bible, follow this link: The Holy Bible & related books.

Conclusion

Intellectual bankruptcy is killing millions and millions of people every day. It is the number one killer. However, people accept to be killed by intellectual bankruptcy unnecessarily, because plenty of good knowledge is readily available. This is the information age. The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Well informed people are resilient, resourceful, quick-witted, men of action not men of thoughts, leaders not followers, fearless, go-getters, peace makers, creatives. The reason well informed people are well informed it’s because they read books avidly – they are hungry for knowledge. They are eager to learn. Ignoramuses deserve the worst.

I reiterate:

The choice is yours – choose intellectual bankruptcy and get killed or choose to read books avidly and survive.

Problem not problems
Only a single problem worldwide

Problems this, problems that; their problems are too big, this will cause problems, I can’t handle my problems, we must fix our problems first, let me know if you have any problems etc., etc. – meaningless statements! I repeat, I say all these are meaningless statements!

Disasters, penury, adversities, unemployment, death, crime, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance – these are things which afflict the human race severely. They have been part of living since the origin of evil. Nonetheless, not even one of them can be categorised as a problem. You believe this is a crazy talk? Have you ever heard a crazy talk of this kind? Well, you will comprehend what you have not realised, since you were born.

Virtually every human being believes that a problem is something which is so-called difficult to understand or to deal with. Such is an atrocious belief triggering a weighty load of nonsense all around the world, it must be quitted. All these things the world regards as problems are not problems at all. ‘Problems’ is a meaningless word; problems do not exist, they never did, only a problem.

Be careful. This information is totally a big job. Absolutely, this is the only way I have to put it, hitting the nail on the head so that those who are willing can remark. One thing is certain: this world requires more accurate teachings.

Right now, the truth is declaring that all such situations like death, crime, penury, adversities, unemployment, disasters, maladies, depression, politics, and ignorance should not be classed as problems because problems do not exist at all, and they never did, only a problem. Nonetheless, you can find that you have already opted to be totally surprised, how it can be this way.

You have to adhere to the truth not lies, be totally eager to learn more and you will never be an ignoramus.

On the whole, a problem is a thing regarded as difficult to understand or to deal with. Is there anything difficult to understand or to deal with? What sort of a thing which can be classed as difficult to understand or to deal with? First of all, let me clarify what the word difficult so-called means. Difficult so-called means: not easy, needing effort or skill to do or to understand. Such a definition truly leads all human beings astray. If carrying out or to understand a particular thing requires effort or skill, verily it is a truth, and what is the matter? Answer this question before reading further.   

Easy versus difficult/not easy

The erroneous belief of so-called problems was apparently started with a misapprehension in the word easy. Easy is stupidly defined as: not difficult; done or obtained without a lot of effort. However, truthfully, nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Full stop! People do not know that effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking. You know the meaning of thinking. I explained in detail about Thinking in chapter 2.

There is no small thinking or big thinking, only thinking. Problems, difficult, not easy; these words terribly influence persons to choose to be disturbed. Remember what I said in chapter 1 that, ‘something’ is worthy matter and a source of energy only. Problems, difficult, and not easy are sources but not of worthy energy but sources of negative impression. Negative impression is not worthy energy. 

Nothing is easy on earth; nothing is difficult on earth, work must just be done, effort must just be applied. Effort is immeasurable because thinking is the same, whether in carrying out small or big jobs; it is just thinking.
